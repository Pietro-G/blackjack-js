## Rationale
The project is my take on learning Java Script, and thus I have utilized a [boiler plate](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/fullsource/6196-card-version1/fullsource.zip) and other online resources. I wanted to make this challenge about also learning a new skill, as I have never even made a "Hello World" for any of these frameworks before.

I chose to show all the cards that are being handled and instead focus simply on making it look presentable enough, as I often find a lot of chances to do CLI games, but not many to learn skills heavily use in industry.

If I had more time to develop this, I would certainly write tests and change a lot of the assets. A lot of my time was consumed with PixiJS which was headed a bit too far into unknown territory.

I initially started by trying to utiize Flask and hook a Backend python script to a project, however quickly realizing that Flask was rather hard to provision Dynamically I went ahead and ventured into `Node`, which I simply wanted to learn for the sake of not having to run two terminals as client/server but rather host one.

Then comes `express` as I also want to eventually use a similar architecture for some of my other projects with more complicated routes. In this particular project it isn't crucial but I learnt how easy it would be to simply add more website routes during this challenge.

`Bootstrap` was rather nice when dealing with HTML5, I learned some of the wonders the Twitter team envisioned and carried out perfectly. If I ever had to do another website, I would probably do it in half the time.

As for the JavaScript utilized for the backend, it was quite an experience, and I missed my OOP principles since I'm mostly using Python, C#, C and Java for most my projects. But overall, I'm happy with what came out of the challenge.


If I had more time, I would most certainly attempt again to use PixiJS and exploring more NPM modules alongside utilizing WebPack so that I could bundle many JS files.
